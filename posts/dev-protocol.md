Dev Protocol is a decentralized middleware that enhances individual activities and supports sustainability through staking. It uses the activities of open source creators as the mining power and enables open assets to be economically valued and rewarded. Supporters stake DEV coin and help the sustainability of creators' projects and earn rewards too. Dev Protocol creates an open and decentralized ecosystem that is autonomously enhanced by users, through opening new asset markets and proposing policies.<!--more-->
