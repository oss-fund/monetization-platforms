Opire is a bounty platform where anyone can put bounties on any GitHub issue, which are only paid out once resolved. Contributors earn money by solving these challenges and claiming rewards. The platform promotes collaboration by allowing multiple bounties to be pooled together, and contributors can also receive tips for their efforts. With lower fees, Opire encourages more contributions and fosters an engaged community of problem-solvers.<!--more-->
